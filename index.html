    <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>My family just moved around a lot, so I had <strong>NO</strong> control over where I lived in my formative years. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Abilene <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Colorado City <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Houston <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Sunnyvale <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Mesquite <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Forney <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Austin <span>&ast;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cities I Want to Visit</h1>
    <p>Turkey is a place I love, but haven't been to the beach there yet. Slavic studies was my minor, so I love anything and everything Russia, and who doesn't want to go to Japan, am I right?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Izmir, Turkey <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>St. Petersburg, Russia <span>&ast;</span></li>
      <li>Tokyo, Japan <span>&ast;</span></li>
    </ol>
